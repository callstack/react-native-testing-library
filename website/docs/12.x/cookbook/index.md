# Introduction

Welcome to the **React Native Testing Library (RNTL) Cookbook**!
This app is your go-to resource for learning how to effectively test React Native applications.
It provides a collection of **best practices**, **ready-made recipes**, and **tips & tricks** to
simplify and improve your testing workflow. Whether youâ€™re a beginner just getting started or a
seasoned developer looking to sharpen your
skills, the Cookbook has something for everyone.

## What's Inside the Cookbook?

The Cookbook is currently organized into **three main chapters**:

- **Basic Recipes**: A great starting point, covering essential testing scenarios such as async
  operations and custom render functions.
- **Advanced Recipes**: More complex scenarios like network requests and in the future, navigation
  testing and more.
- **State Management Recipes**: Best practices for testing state management libraries

Each recipe includes a clear explanation along with a corresponding code example to help you get
hands-on with testing. Checkout

recipes in action.
