:::note
Built-in Jest matchers require RNTL v12.4.0 or later.
:::

This guide describes built-in Jest matchers, we recommend using these matchers as they provide more readable tests, better accessibility support, and a better developer experience.

If you are already using legacy Jest Native matchers we have a [migration guide](migration-jest-native) for moving to the built-in matchers.

## Element Existence

### `toBeOnTheScreen()`

```ts
expect(element).toBeOnTheScreen()
```

This allows you to assert whether an element is attached to the element tree or not. If you hold a reference to an element and it gets unmounted during the test it will no longer pass this assertion.

## Element Content

### `toHaveTextContent()`

```ts
expect(element).toHaveTextContent(
  text: string | RegExp,
  options?: {
    exact?: boolean;
    normalizer?: (text: string) => string;
  },
)
```

This allows you to assert whether the given element has the given text content or not. It accepts either `string` or `RegExp` matchers, as well as [text match options](Queries.md#text-match-options) of `exact` and `normalizer`.

### `toContainElement()`

```ts
expect(container).toContainElement(
  element: ReactTestInstance | null,
)
```

This allows you to assert whether the given container element does contain another host element.

### `toBeEmptyElement()`

```ts
expect(element).toBeEmptyElement()
```

This allows you to assert whether the given element does not have any host child elements or text content.





## Element State

### `toHaveDisplayValue()`

```ts
expect(element).toHaveDisplayValue(
  value: string | RegExp,
  options?: {
    exact?: boolean;
    normalizer?: (text: string) => string;
  },
)
```

This allows you to assert whether the given `TextInput` element has a specified display value. It accepts either `string` or `RegExp` matchers, as well as [text match options](Queries.md#text-match-options) of `exact` and `normalizer`.

### `toHaveAccessibilityValue()`

```ts
expect(element).toHaveAccessibilityValue(
  value: {
    min?: number;
    max?: number;
    now?: number;
    text?: string | RegExp;
  },
)
```

This allows you to assert whether the given element has a specified accessible value.

This matcher will assert accessibility value based on `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuetext` and `accessibilityValue` props. Only defined value entries will be used in the assertion,  the element might have additional accessibility value entries and still be matched.

When querying by `text` entry a string or `RegExp` might be used.


### `toBeEnabled()` / `toBeDisabled` {#tobeenabled}

```ts
expect(element).toBeEnabled()
expect(element).toBeDisabled()
```

These allow you to assert whether the given element is enabled or disabled from the user's perspective. It relies on the accessibility disabled state as set by `aria-disabled` or `accessibilityState.disabled` props. It will consider a given element disabled when it or any of its ancestors is disabled.

:::note
These matchers are the negation of each other, and both are provided to avoid double negations in your assertions.
:::


### `toBeSelected()`

```ts
expect(element).toBeSelected()
```

This allows you to assert whether the given element is selected from the user's perspective. It relies on the accessibility selected state as set by `aria-selected` or `accessibilityState.selected` props.


### `toBeChecked()` / `toBePartiallyChecked()` {#tobechecked}

```ts
expect(element).toBeChecked()
expect(element).toBePartiallyChecked()
```

These allow you to assert whether the given element is checked or partially checked from the user's perspective. It relies on the accessibility checked state as set by `aria-checked` or `accessibilityState.checked` props.

:::note
* `toBeChecked()` matcher works only on elements with the `checkbox` or `radio` role.
* `toBePartiallyChecked()` matcher works only on elements with the `checkbox` role.
:::

### `toBeExpanded()` /  `toBeCollapsed()` {#tobeexpanded}

```ts
expect(element).toBeExpanded()
expect(element).toBeCollapsed()
```

These allows you to assert whether the given element is expanded or collapsed from the user's perspective. It relies on the accessibility disabled state as set by `aria-expanded` or `accessibilityState.expanded` props.

:::note
These matchers are the negation of each other for expandable elements (elements with explicit `aria-expanded` or `accessibilityState.expanded` props). However, both won't pass for non-expandable elements (ones without explicit `aria-expanded` or `accessibilityState.expanded` props).
:::


### `toBeBusy()`

```ts
expect(element).toBeBusy()
```

This allows you to assert whether the given element is busy from the user's perspective. It relies on the accessibility selected state as set by `aria-busy` or `accessibilityState.busy` props.

## Element Styles

### `toBeVisible()`

```ts
expect(element).toBeVisible()
```

This allows you to assert whether the given element is visible from the user's perspective. 

The element is considered invisible when itself or any of its ancestors has `display: none` or `opacity: 0` styles, as well as when it's hidden from accessibility.

### `toHaveStyle()`

```ts
expect(element).toHaveStyle(
  style: StyleProp<Style>,
)
```

This allows you to assert whether the given element has given styles. 

## Other

### `toHaveAccessibleName()`

```ts
expect(element).toHaveAccessibleName(
  name?: string | RegExp,
  options?: {
    exact?: boolean;
    normalizer?: (text: string) => string;
  },
)
```

This allows you to assert whether the given element has a specified accessible name. It accepts either `string` or `RegExp` matchers, as well as [text match options](Queries.md#text-match-options) of `exact` and `normalizer`.

The accessible name will be computed based on `aria-labelledby`, `accessibilityLabelledBy`, `aria-label`, and `accessibilityLabel` props, in the absence of these props, the element text content will be used.

When the `name` parameter is `undefined` it will only check if the element has any accessible name.

### `toHaveProp()`

```ts
expect(element).toHaveProp(
  name: string,
  value?: unknown,
)
```

This allows you to assert whether the given element has a given prop. When the `value` parameter is `undefined` it will only check for existence of the prop, and when `value` is defined it will check if the actual value matches passed value.

:::note
This matcher should be treated as an escape hatch to be used when all other matchers are not suitable.
