# Migration to 11.x

Migration to React Native Testing Library version 11 from version 9.x or 10.x should be a relatively easy task due small amount of breaking changes.

## Breaking changes

### Update to Jest 28 if you use fake timers

If you use fake timers in any of your tests you should update your Jest dependencies to version 28. This is due to the fact that [`jest.useFakeTimers()` config structure](https://jestjs.io/docs/jest-object#jestusefaketimersfaketimersconfig) has changed.

### Refactor legacy `waitForOptions` position

In version 9 we introducted query `options` parameters for each query type. This affected all `findBy` and `findAllBy` queries because their signatures changed e.g. from:

```ts
function findByText(text: TextMatch, waitForOptions?: WaitForOptions);
function findAllByText(text: TextMatch, waitForOptions?: WaitForOptions);
```

to

```ts
function findByText(text: TextMatch, options?: TextMatchOptions, waitForOptions?: WaitForOptions);
function findAllByText(
  text: TextMatch,
  options?: TextMatchOptions,
  waitForOptions?: WaitForOptions
);
```

In order to facilitate transition, in version 9 and 10, we provided a temporary possibility to pass `WaitForOptions` like `timeout`, `interval`, etc inside `options` argument. From this release we require passing these as the proper third parameter.

This change is easy to implement:

```ts
findByText(/Text/, { timeout: 1000 });
```

should become

```ts
findByText(/Text/, {}, { timeout: 1000 });
```

### Triggering non-touch events on targets with `pointerEvents="box-none"` prop

Up to version 10, RNTL disables all events for a target with `pointerEvents="box-none"`. This behavior is counter to how React Native itself functions.

From version 11, RNTL continues to disable `press` event for these targets but allows triggering other events, e.g. `layout`.
