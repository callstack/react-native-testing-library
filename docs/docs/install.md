# Installation

Open a Terminal in your project's folder and run:

```sh
yarn add --dev react-native-testing-library
```

This library has a peerDependencies listing for `react-test-renderer` and, of course, `react`. Make sure to install them too!

As you may have noticed, it's not tied to React Native at all â€“ you can safely use it in your React components if you feel like not interacting directly with DOM.
