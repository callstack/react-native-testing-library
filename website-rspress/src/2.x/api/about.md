# About

API documentation for Re.Pack is split into few categories:

- [`React Native API`](./react-native/index.md) - documentation for client-facing APIs, which you can use inside your application, for example `ChunkManager`.
- [`Node API`](./node/index.md) - documentation for APIs used to configure bundling or development processes: Webpack plugins, utilities and commands.
