# Web support

Re.Pack is designed to alter the bundle generated by Webpack to make it runnable in React Native. As such, it's extremely specific to React Native and the code produced by it, __will not work__ on Web.

:::danger

__You should never use Re.Pack when creating a bundle for Web!__

:::

Instead, you should create 2 separate Webpack configs, for example:

- `webpack.config.react-native.{js,mjs,cjs}` - Configured Webpack for React Native __and uses Re.Pack__.
- `webpack.config.web.{js,mjs,cjs}` - Configures Webpack for Web __without Re.Pack__.

If you need to share common config, you can create `webpack.config.base.{js,mjs,cjs}` for the common options and import it inside `webpack.config.react-native.{js,mjs,cjs}` and `webpack.config.web.{js,mjs,cjs}`.

:::tip

Make sure you specify `--webpack-config <path>` when running `react-native webpack-start` or `react-native webpack-bundle` and `--config <path>` when running Webpack CLI for Web.
