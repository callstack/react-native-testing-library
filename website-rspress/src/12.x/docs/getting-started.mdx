# Getting Started

## Pre-requisites

If you're already familiar with JavaScript, React Native and Webpack, then you'll be able to get moving quickly! Otherwise, it's highly recommended to get yourself familiar with these topic and then come back here:

- [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Webpack concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

## Minimum requirements

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- React Native >= 0.72.0

:::tip
The information on this page might not always be up-to-date. Official support is provided for the latest version of React Native and its 2 previous versions, [similar to how React Native is supported](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases). If you're using older version of React Native, you can still try using Re.Pack, but you might need to adjust the configuration to make it work.
:::

## Note on Expo

Officially, Re.Pack doesn't support Expo. It might be possible to use Re.Pack in Expo projects, but it would require more work and setup. We welcome anyone who would like to contribute and bring Expo support to Re.Pack.

## Examples

If you get stuck or you want to explore beforehand, you can use the examples of React Native applications using Re.Pack here: https://github.com/callstack/repack-examples.

## Installation

To create a new React Native project with Re.Pack or adapt an existing one:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Steps>
  ### [Optional] Initialize a new project using React Native Community CLI 
  ```bash 
  npx react-native init AwesomeProject --skip-install 
  ``` 
  ### Go to your React Native project root directory
   ```bash 
  cd AwesomeProject
  ```
  ### Convert the project to use Re.Pack
  ```bash 
  npx @callstack/repack-init
  ```
</Steps>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

In case your project structure differs from the default template, you can follow the manual installation steps [down below](#manual-installation).

:::details
By default, `@callstack/repack-init` will create `webpack.config.mjs` file in the root directory of your project.
If you want to use `.cjs` format, you can pass `--cjs` flag to the command.
You can read more about these formats [down below](#3-webpack-config).
:::

## Usage

After completing [Installation](#installation) you should be able to use Re.Pack's development server and bundle your application.

Keep in mind that, you might need to adjust [Webpack config](./configuration/webpack-config) to your project in order for the application to work correctly. It's impossible for us to know what your project looks like and uses, so it's recommended to read through the Webpack config's code and comments and make sure you understand what's going on there.

### Running development server

When developing your application, you want to run Re.Pack's development server to compile your source code with Webpack.

The recommended way is to use React Native Community CLI and run:

<PackageManagerTabs command="run react-native start" />

or

<PackageManagerTabs command="run react-native webpack-start" />

### Bundling the app

When building the release version of your application via XCode, Gradle CLI or Android Studio, as long as you followed [Configure XCode](#4-configure-xcode) and [Configure Android](#5-configure-android), it should use Re.Pack to bundle your application.

If you want to create bundle (development or production), **the recommended way is to use React Native Community CLI and run**:

<PackageManagerTabs command="run react-native bundle" />

or

<PackageManagerTabs command="run react-native webpack-bundle" />

## Manual installation

If the [automatic installation](#installation) didn't work for any reason, or your project structure differs from the default React Native template, you can follow these manual installation steps:

### 1. Dependencies

Install required dependencies in your project:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D webpack terser-webpack-plugin babel-loader @callstack/repack" />

This will install latest versions of Webpack, Re.Pack and dependencies used in Webpack config: `terser-webpack-plugin` for minification and `babel-loader` for transpiling the code.

If you already have Webpack or Re.Pack installed, you might want to check the [compatibility table](#compatibility-with-webpack) to ensure all dependencies are ok.

Once the dependencies are installed, you need to tell React Native Community CLI to add Re.Pack's commands.

### 2. Commands

Add the following content to `react-native.config.js` (or create it if it doesn't exist):

```js title="react-native.config.js"
module.exports = {
  commands: require('@callstack/repack/commands'),
};
```

This will allow you to use Re.Pack when running `react-native start` and `react-native bundle` commands.

### 3. Webpack config

Create file `webpack.config.mjs` in the root directory of your project and paste the content from our [Webpack config template](https://github.com/callstack/repack/blob/main/templates/webpack.config.mjs).

:::info

We recommend to use ESM version of Webpack config with the `.mjs` extension. However, Re.Pack also supports ESM under `.js` and CJS variant under `.js` and `.cjs` extensions. Check our [templates](https://github.com/callstack/repack/blob/main/templates/) for CJS and ESM variants as well as the documentation on [Webpack config](./configuration/webpack-config) to see the list of all available Webpack config location and extensions.

:::

### 4. Configure XCode

When building release version of your application XCode project will still use Metro to bundle the application, so you need to adjust build settings to make XCode use Re.Pack instead.

Open your application's Xcode project/workspace and:

1. Click on the project in **_Project navigator_** panel on the left
2. Go to **_Build Phases_** tab
3. Expand **_Bundle React Native code and images_** phase
4. Add `export BUNDLE_COMMAND=webpack-bundle` to the phase

After the change, the content of this phase should look similar to:

```bash title="Bundle React Native code and images" {4}
set -e

WITH_ENVIRONMENT="../node_modules/react-native/scripts/xcode/with-environment.sh"
export BUNDLE_COMMAND=webpack-bundle
REACT_NATIVE_XCODE="../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh"

/bin/sh -c "$WITH_ENVIRONMENT $REACT_NATIVE_XCODE"
```

### 5. Configure Android

When building release version of your application Gradle will still use Metro to bundle the application, so you need to adjust build settings to make Gradle use Re.Pack instead.

Open your application's Gradle project, usually located at `android/app/build.gradle` and add the following:

```groovy title="android/app/build.gradle" {2}
react {
    bundleCommand = "webpack-bundle"
}
```
