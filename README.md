## The problem

You want to write maintainable tests for your React Native components. As a part of this goal, you want your tests to avoid including implementation details of your components and rather focus on making your tests give you the confidence for which they are intended. As part of this, you want your tests to be maintainable in the long run so refactors of your components (changes to implementation but not functionality) don't break your tests and slow you and your team down.

## This solution

The React Native Testing Library (RNTL) is a lightweight solution for testing React Native components. It provides light utility functions on top of `react-test-renderer`, in a way that encourages better testing practices. Its primary guiding principle is:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.

This project is inspired by [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library). Tested to work with Jest, but it should work with other test runners as well.

## Installation

Open a Terminal in your project's folder and run:

#### Using `yarn`

```sh
yarn add --dev @testing-library/react-native
```

#### Using `npm`

```sh
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react-native
```

This library has a `peerDependencies` listing for `react-test-renderer`. Make sure that your `react-test-renderer` version matches exactly the `react` version.

### Additional Jest matchers

You can use the built-in Jest matchers by adding the following line to your `jest-setup.ts` file (configured using [`setupFilesAfterEnv`](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#setupfilesafterenv-array)):

```ts
import '@testing-library/react-native/extend-expect';
```

### Custom Jest Preset (React Native before 0.71)

We generally advise using the "react-native" preset when testing with this library.

However, if you use React Native version earlier than 0.71 with [modern Jest fake timers](https://jestjs.io/blog/2020/05/05/jest-26#new-fake-timers) (default since Jest 27), you'll need to apply this custom Jest preset or otherwise awaiting promises, like using `waitFor` or `findBy*`, queries will fail with a timeout.

This is a [known issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/29303). It happens because React Native's Jest preset overrides native Promise. Our preset restores it to defaults, which is not a problem in most apps out there.

Here's how you apply a custom preset in your Jest config:

```json
{
  "preset": "@testing-library/react-native"
}
```

If this doesn't work for you, please fall back to using "legacy" fake timers.

### Flow

Note for [Flow](https://flow.org) users ‚Äì you'll also need to install typings for `react-test-renderer`:

```sh
flow-typed install react-test-renderer
```

## Example

```jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import { QuestionsBoard } from '../QuestionsBoard';

test('form submits two answers', () => {
  const allQuestions = ['q1', 'q2'];
  const mockFn = jest.fn();

  render(<QuestionsBoard questions={allQuestions} onSubmit={mockFn} />);

  const answerInputs = screen.getAllByLabelText('answer input');

  fireEvent.changeText(answerInputs[0], 'a1');
  fireEvent.changeText(answerInputs[1], 'a2');
  fireEvent.press(screen.getByText('Submit'));

  expect(mockFn).toBeCalledWith({
    1: { q: 'q1', a: 'a1' },
    2: { q: 'q2', a: 'a2' },
  });
});
```

You can find the source of `QuestionsBoard` component and this example [here](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library/blob/main/src/__tests__/questionsBoard.test.tsx).

## API / Usage

The [public API](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api) of `@testing-library/react-native` is focused around these essential methods:

- [`render`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api#render) ‚Äì deeply renders the given React element and returns helpers to query the output components.
- [`fireEvent`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api#fireevent) - invokes named event handler on the element.
- [`waitFor`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api#waitfor) - waits for non-deterministic periods of time until the queried element is added or times out.
- [`waitForElementToBeRemoved`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api#waitforelementtoberemoved) - waits for non-deterministic periods of time until the queried element is removed or times out.
- [`within`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/api#within) - creates a queries object scoped for a given element.
