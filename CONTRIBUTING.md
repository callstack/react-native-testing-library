# Contributing to react-native-testing-library

## Code of Conduct

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please read [the full text](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Our Development Process

The core team works directly on GitHub and all work is public.

### Development workflow

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this *free* series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master` (a guide on [how to fork a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)).
2. Run `yarn bootstrap` to setup the developement environment.
3. Do the changes you want and test them out in the example app before sending a pull request.

### Commit message convention

We prefix our commit messages with one of the following to signify the kind of change:

* `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix Button color on DarkTheme.
* `feat`: new features, e.g. add Snackbar component.
* `refactor`: code/structure refactor, e.g. new structure folder for components.
* `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for Button.
* `test`: adding or updating tests, eg unit, snapshot testing.
* `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change circle ci config.
* `BREAKING`: for changes that break existing usage, e.g. change API of a component.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.

### Linting and tests

We use `flow` for type checking, `eslint` with `prettier` for linting and formatting the code, and `jest` for testing. Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when commiting. You can also run the following commands manually:

* `yarn flow`: run flow on all files.
* `yarn lint`: run eslint and prettier.
* `yarn test`: run tests.

### Sending a pull request

When you're sending a pull request:

* Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
* Verify that `flow`, `eslint` and tests are passing.
* Preview the documentation to make sure it looks good.
* Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.

When you're working on a component:

* Follow the guidelines described in the [official material design docs](https://material.io/guidelines/).
* Write a brief description of every prop when defining `type Props` to aid with documentation.
* Provide an example usage for the component (check other components to get a idea).

### Running the example

The example app uses [Expo](https://expo.io/). You will need to install the Expo app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) to start developing.

After you're done, you can run `yarn start` or `expo start` in the `example/` folder and scan the QR code to launch it on your device.

### Working on documentation

The documentation is automatically generated from the [flowtype](https://flowtype.org) annotations in the components. You can add comments above the type annotations to add descriptions. To preview the generated documentation, run `yarn start` in the `docs/` folder.

## Reporting issues

You can report issues on our [bug tracker](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library/issues). Please follow the issue template when opening an issue.
