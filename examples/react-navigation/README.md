# RNTL example app for React Navigation

**Note: this example is stale and might not function correctly.**

This example shows how to write integration tests using React Navigation without mocking it. Presented approach has been consulted with and influenced by React Navigation team.

## Recommended tests

There are two types of recommeded tests:

1. Tests operating on navigator level - these use `renderNavigator` helper to render a navigator component used in the app. It is useful when you want to test a scenario that includes multiple screens.
2. Tests operating on single screen level - these use regular `render` helper but require refactoring screen components into `Screen` and `ScreenContent` components. Where `Screen` receives React Navigation props and/or uses hooks like `useNavigation` while `ScreenContent` does not have a direct relation to React Navigation API but gets props from `Screen` and calls relevant callbacks to trigger navigation.

## Non-recommended tests

There also exists another popular type of screen level tests, where users mock React Navigation objects like `navigation`, `route` and/or hooks like `useNavigation`, etc. We don't recommend this way of testing. **Mocking internal parts of the libraries is effectively testing implementation details, which goes against the Testing Library's [Guiding Principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles/)**.
