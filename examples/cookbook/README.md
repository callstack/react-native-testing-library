# React Native Testing Library Cookbook App
Welcome to the React Native Testing Library (RNTL) Cookbook! This app is designed to provide developers with a collection of best practices, ready-made recipes, and tips & tricks to help you effectively test your React Native applications. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out with testing or looking to deepen your skills, this cookbook offers something for everyone.

Each recipe described in the Cookbook should have a corresponding code example screen in this repo.

Note:
Since examples will showcase usage of different dependencies, the dependencies in `package.json`
file will grow much larger that in a normal React Native. This is fine üê∂‚òïÔ∏èüî•.

## Running the App
1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:callstack/react-native-testing-library.git`
2. Go to the `examples/cookbook` directory `cd examples/cookbook`
3. Install dependencies `yarn`
4. Run the app `yarn start`
5. Run the app either on iOS or Android by clicking on `i` or `a` in the terminal.

## How to Contribute
We invite all developers, from beginners to experts, to contribute your own recipes! If you have a clever solution, best practice, or useful tip, we encourage you to:

1. Submit a Pull Request with your recipe.
2. Join the conversation on GitHub [here](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library/issues/1624) to discuss ideas, ask questions, or provide feedback.
