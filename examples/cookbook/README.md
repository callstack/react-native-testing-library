# RNTL Cookbook

This example app gathers recipes from
the [RNTL Cookbook](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/cookbook).

Each recipe described in the Cookbook should have a corresponding code example screen in this repo.

Note:
Since examples will showcase usage of different dependencies, the dependencies in `package.json`
file will grow much larger that in a normal React Native. This is fine 🐶☕️🔥.


## Running the app

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:callstack/react-native-testing-library.git`
2. Go to the `examples/cookbook` directory `cd examples/cookbook`
3. Install dependencies `yarn`
4. Run the app `yarn start`
5. Run the app either on iOS or Android by clicking on `i` or `a` in the terminal.
