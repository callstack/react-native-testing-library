# RNTL Cookbook

This example app gathers recipes from
the [RNTL Cookbook](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/cookbook).

Each recipe described in the Cookbook should have a corresponding code example screen in this repo.

Note:
Since examples will showcase usage of different dependencies, the dependencies in `package.json`
file will grow much larger that in a normal React Native. This is fine 🐶☕️🔥.
